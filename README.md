Common sports betting functions in R

A collection of common betting functions partially inspired by the betting functions in excel [posted by Ganchrow at SBR](https://www.sportsbookreview.com/picks/tools/sports-betting-functions-for-excel/)

These functions are for my own personal. They aren't properly documented, don't fail safely, and aren't the most efficent way of doing things. But they work for me and you might find them useful.
